# How long is the string?

In this stage, we will adapt code from previous stages to run in HTML
pages. You will need to put this code in a file with the `.html`
name extension (such as `stage-5-1-length.html`) and then open
the HTML file in a browser to see it run.

Here, we take the stage-1 example of finding out the length of input, and
put it in a web page.
