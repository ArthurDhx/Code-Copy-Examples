# Nick-book

In olden times, people would have phonebooks where they kept their 
contacts. Now nobody calls anymore, so let's keep track of our friends' 
online handles (*nicks*) instead.

This program doesn't actually store the data, so as soon as we stop it, it 
will forget everyone. We'll learn about databases later.

Can you make it say "no matches found" if a search fails? Can you make it 
say "command not recognized" when the user enters an unknown command?

Can you add more commands? Useful ones might be to delete a person, to list 
known people in order in which we added them, in reverse order (from the 
newest contacts first), or even alphabetically (by nick and/or by name), but 
that's much more of a challenge now because we haven't talked about sorting 
yet.
