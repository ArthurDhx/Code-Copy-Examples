# Code Examples to Copy, Extras – Milliways example

This page has the final code from our session on programming locally and using
loops and functions.

Typing code helps you learn, so rather than giving you text to copy
and paste the code is an image that you must read, hold in your mind,
type in to your editor and then manually check for accuracy.

When we type, we make mistakes and that's OK – finding what we've done
wrong is part of programming so this is a useful experience.

Always test your program with a few different inputs to see that it behaves as
expected.

As always, we encourage your feedback on the process and the examples.
