# Draw several colourful towers

To draw several towers side-by-side so their bottoms align, we need to
find out how high the tallest tower is, and then print empty layers above
the shorter towers.

Note that much of this program is similar to the previous one; there are
comments where the same code starts and where it starts to differ again.

The code that splits the input into words, and creates tower descriptions
for each word, is intentionally advanced. Try to rewrite the
`split()` and the `map()` lines using loops.
