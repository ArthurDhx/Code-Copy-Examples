# Play [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)

We use the ideas from the examples above to make a program that plays the
[Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) puzzle.

You don't have to type the huge block comment at the beginning unless you
want to practice typing.

The program solves the puzzle itself, but we could let the user play it.
Can you make an interactive version that would keep asking the user for a
single move, do the move, and stop when the tower is completely moved?
