# A better solution to [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)

The code above can only solve towers of height 4, and fails with larger or
smaller towers. Functions like `moveTwoBlocks` quickly become
repetitive; we just *know* that computers can do better.

This program solves the puzzle *recursively* – by having a function
`moveBlocks` that calls itself to do a part of its task.
