<h1>Code Examples to Copy</h1>

<p>
  This page has code examples for you to try out.

<p>
  Typing code helps you learn, so rather than giving you text to copy
  and paste the code is an image that you must read, hold in your mind,
  type in to your editor and then manually check for accuracy.

<p>
  When we type, we make mistakes and that's OK â€“ finding what we've done
  wrong is part of programming so this is a useful experience.

<p>
  Always test your program with a few different inputs to see that it behaves as
  expected.

  <h2>Editing</h2>

  <p>
    To get started we suggest you use a cloud-based editor and runtime environment, such as <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>.

  <p>
    In repl.it, you can create files and run them.  Here's an example of us doing just that with the first example from below:
  </p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Spil5vd8ba4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can use your own environment. If you use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, for a quick start we have prepared a github repository with some custom editor settings: <a href="https://github.com/portsoc/vscode-env-ccx">vscode-env-ccx</a>.
  
  <p>
    As always we encourage your feedback on the process and the examples.

  <h2>Stages</h2>

  <h3><a href="pages/stage-1.html">Stage 1</a></h3>

  <p>
    Basic Examples
  <hr>

  <h3><a href="pages/stage-2.html">Stage 2</a></h3>

  <p>
    In this stage, we add objects, arrays, and loops.
  <hr>

  <h3><a href="pages/stage-3.html">Stage 3</a></h3>

  <p>
    In this stage, we add functions and one more external package.
  <hr>

  <h3><a href="pages/stage-4.html">Stage 4</a></h3>

  <p>
    In this stage, you cannot run these programs in Repl.it anymore
    because we deal with command-line arguments and files.
    Put each program into a file so you can run it with Node.js.
  <hr>

  <h3><a href="pages/stage-5.html">Stage 5</a></h3>

  <p>
    In this stage, we will challenge you to change code from previous stages to
    run in HTML pages.

  <h3><a href="pages/extras-milliways.html">Extras milliways</a></h3>

  <p>
    This page has the final code from our session on programming locally and using
    loops and functions.
