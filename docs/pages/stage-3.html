<p>This page has code examples for you to try out.
In this stage, we add functions and one more external package.</p>
<p>Typing code helps you learn, so rather than giving you text to copy
and paste the code is an image that you must read, hold in your mind,
type in to your editor and then manually check for accuracy.</p>
<p>When we type, we make mistakes and that's OK – finding what we've done
wrong is part of programming so this is a useful experience.</p>
<p>Always test your program with a few different inputs to see that it behaves as
expected.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage your feedback on the process and the examples.</p>

<section class="examples">

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="1-is-prime.js.md">
  <h2>Prime check  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Prime numbers are positive integers only divisible by 1 and themselves, and
no other integers. 4 is not a prime because it is 2*2; 5 is a prime.</p>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="2-reverse-array.js.md">
  <h2>Reverse an array  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>If we have an array <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> and we reverse it, we should get
<code>[3, 2, 1]</code>.</p>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="3-is-palindrome.js.md">
  <h2>Palindrome check  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>A word is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g.
racecar. We reuse the <code>reverseArray()</code> function to reverse a
string.</p>
  <img alt="Palindrome check" src="../img/stage-3-3-is-palindrome.js.png">
  <p>Can you change the program so that an empty string is not reported as a palindrome?</p>
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="4-dice-roll.js.md">
  <h2>Dice roll  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Create a simple <code>diceRoll()</code> function to simulate a roll of a
single dice. We will use it later.</p>
  <img alt="Dice roll" src="../img/stage-3-4-dice-roll.js.png">

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="5-dice-counts.js.md">
  <h2>Is the dice loaded?  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Let's see if the dice favour some number.</p>
  <img alt="Is the dice loaded?" src="../img/stage-3-5-dice-counts.js.png">
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="6-dice-histogram.js.md">
  <h2>Is the dice loaded? (graph)  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Let's see if the dice favour some number, this time as a nice graph.</p>
  <img alt="Is the dice loaded? (graph)" src="../img/stage-3-6-dice-histogram.js.png">
  <p>Instead of rolling just one dice, can you change the program to roll two
dice at a time? We should see that 2 (=1+1) and 12 (=6+6) are the least
common results.</p>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="7-draw-tower.js.md">
  <h2>Draw a tower  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Just for fun, draw a word tower of characters.</p>
  <img alt="Draw a tower" src="../img/stage-3-7-draw-tower.js.png">
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="8-draw-color-towers.js.md">
  <h2>Draw a colourful tower  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Add a splash of <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/colors">colour</a>.
Note that much of this program is similar to the previous one; there are
comments where the same code starts and where it starts to differ again.</p>

<h1>Advanced variations</h1>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="9-draw-more-towers.js.md">
  <h2>Draw several colourful towers  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>To draw several towers side-by-side so their bottoms align, we need to
find out how high the tallest tower is, and then print empty layers above
the shorter towers.</p>
<p>Note that much of this program is similar to the previous one; there are
comments where the same code starts and where it starts to differ again.</p>
  <img alt="Draw several colourful towers" src="../img/stage-3-9-draw-more-towers.js.png">
  <p>The code that splits the input into words, and creates tower descriptions
for each word, is intentionally advanced. Try to rewrite the
<code>split()</code> and the <code>map()</code> lines using loops.</p>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="10-hanoi-towers.js.md">
  <h2>Play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a>  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>We use the ideas from the examples above to make a program that plays the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a> puzzle.</p>
<p>You don't have to type the huge block comment at the beginning unless you
want to practice typing.</p>
  <img alt="Play Tower of Hanoi" src="../img/stage-3-10-hanoi-towers.js.png">
  <p>The program solves the puzzle itself, but we could let the user play it.
Can you make an interactive version that would keep asking the user for a
single move, do the move, and stop when the tower is completely moved?</p>

<section data-stage="stage-3" data-example="11-hanoi-towers-recursive.js.md">
  <h2>A better solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a>  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>The code above can only solve towers of height 4, and fails with larger or
smaller towers. Functions like <code>moveTwoBlocks</code> quickly become
repetitive; we just <em>know</em> that computers can do better.</p>
<p>This program solves the puzzle <em>recursively</em> – by having a function
<code>moveBlocks</code> that calls itself to do a part of its task.</p>
  <img alt="A better solution to Tower of Hanoi" src="../img/stage-3-11-hanoi-towers-recursive.js.png">
  <p>Well done getting all the way through, thank you! Let us know how you like
these examples.</p>
