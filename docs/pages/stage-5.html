<p>This page has code examples for you to try out.</p>
<p>In this stage, we will challenge you to change code from previous stages to
run in HTML pages.</p>
<p>Typing code helps you learn, so rather than giving you text to copy
and paste the code is an image that you must read, hold in your mind,
type in to your editor and then manually check for accuracy.</p>
<p>When we type, we make mistakes and that's OK â€“ finding what we've done
wrong is part of programming so this is a useful experience.</p>
<p>Always test your program with a few different inputs to see that it behaves as
expected.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage your feedback on the process and the examples.</p>

<section class="examples">

<section data-stage="stage-5" data-example="1-length.html.md">
  <h2>How long is the string?  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>In this stage, we will adapt code from previous stages to run in HTML
pages. You will need to put this code in a file with the <code>.html</code>
name extension (such as <code>stage-5-1-length.html</code>) and then open
the HTML file in a browser to see it run.</p>
<p>Here, we take the stage-1 example of finding out the length of input, and
put it in a web page.</p>

</section>

<section data-stage="stage-5" data-example="2-is-prime.html.md">
  <h2>Prime check  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Take the prime check function from stage 3 and put it in a web page.</p>
  <img alt="Prime check" src="../img/stage-5-2-is-prime.html.png">
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-5" data-example="3-add.html.md">
  <h2>Add/subtract two numbers  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>In stage 1, we could only add numbers; here we can give the user a much
better calculator as a web page.</p>

</section>

<section data-stage="stage-5" data-example="4-reverse-words.html.md">
  <h2>Reverse words  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Like in stage 4, here we can reverse the characters in each word within the
user's input, whilst maintaining the original order of the words.</p>
  <img alt="Reverse words" src="../img/stage-5-4-reverse-words.html.png">
  <p>Challenge: take three other examples from each of the previous stages and
turn them into web pages with the same or better functionality.</p>
