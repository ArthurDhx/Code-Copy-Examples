<p>This page has code examples for you to try out.
In this stage, we add objects, arrays, and loops.</p>
<p>Typing code helps you learn, so rather than giving you text to copy
and paste the code is an image that you must read, hold in your mind,
type in to your editor and then manually check for accuracy.</p>
<p>When we type, we make mistakes and that's OK â€“ finding what we've done
wrong is part of programming so this is a useful experience.</p>
<p>Always test your program with a few different inputs to see that it behaves as
expected.</p>
<p>As always we encourage your feedback on the process and the examples.</p>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="1-multiply-by-adding.js.md">
  <h2>Multiply by adding  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>We know that 7*3 = 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21:</p>
  <img alt="Multiply by adding" src="../img/stage-2-1-multiply-by-adding.js.png">
  <h3>Extra challenges</h3>
    <div><input class="checkbox hidden extra" type="checkbox"> Can you change the program to do exponentiation? 7^3 = 7*7*7 = 343.</div>
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="2-count-words.js.md">
  <h2>Count words in a sentence  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Actually, we can just count the spaces between words:</p>
  <img alt="Count words in a sentence" src="../img/stage-2-2-count-words.js.png">
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="3-count-words-better.js.md">
  <h2>Count words more accurately  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Consecutive spaces confused the previous program, so here's a smarter one:</p>
  <img alt="Count words more accurately" src="../img/stage-2-3-count-words-better.js.png">
  <p>The program can be shorter. We can drop <code>foundFirstWord</code> if we
pretend that there is a space before the sentence. Try it: set
<code>previousWasSpace</code> to <code>true</code> at first, and remove
<code>foundFirstWord</code> and the first <code>if</code>, only keep the
<code>else</code> part.</p>
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="4-count-sentences.js.md">
  <h2>Count sentences  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Let's assume that every sentence ends with a full stop, and sentences are
separated by spaces:</p>
  <img alt="Count sentences" src="../img/stage-2-4-count-sentences.js.png">
  <p>Can you prevent counting full stops if there are no sentences?
Can you make the program count sentences that end with &quot;?&quot; or &quot;!&quot; as well?</p>
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="5-remove-filename-extension.js.md">
  <h2>Remove file name extension  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Operating systems hide file name extensions because they want to shield
their users from complexities of different file types:</p>
  <img alt="Remove file name extension" src="../img/stage-2-5-remove-filename-extension.js.png">
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="6-generate-random-words.js.md">
  <h2>Generate random words  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Sometimes we need random text (learn about Lorem Ipsum):</p>
  <img alt="Generate random words" src="../img/stage-2-6-generate-random-words.js.png">
  <p>This program always adds a space after the last word. Can you change it so
that unnecessary space isn't there?</p>
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="7-generate-random-sentences.js.md">
  <h2>Generate random sentences  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Random words don't look great; sometimes we want random sentences.</p>
  <img alt="Generate random sentences" src="../img/stage-2-7-generate-random-sentences.js.png">
  <p>Can you somehow make this program output meaningful sentences? It could be
easy to make the program to output sentences like &quot;Alex met Casey. Casey looked at Alex.&quot;</p>
</section>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="8-nickbook.js.md">
  <h2>Nick-book  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>In olden times, people would have phonebooks where they kept their
contacts. Now nobody calls anymore, so let's keep track of our friends'
online handles (<em>nicks</em>) instead.</p>
<p>This program doesn't actually store the data, so as soon as we stop it, it
will forget everyone. We'll learn about databases later.</p>
  <img alt="Nick-book" src="../img/stage-2-8-nickbook.js.png">
  <p>Can you make it say &quot;no matches found&quot; if a search fails? Can you make it
say &quot;command not recognized&quot; when the user enters an unknown command?</p>
<p>Can you add more commands? Useful ones might be to delete a person, to list
known people in order in which we added them, in reverse order (from the
newest contacts first), or even alphabetically (by nick and/or by name), but
that's much more of a challenge now because we haven't talked about sorting
yet.</p>

<h1>Advanced variations</h1>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="9-remove-filename-extension.js.md">
  <h2>Remove file name extension easier  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>Programming languages come with useful functionalities. Here's a shorter
way to remove file name extensions with <code>lastIndexOf</code> and <code>substring</code>.</p>

<section data-stage="stage-2" data-example="10-generate-sentences-with-functions.js.md">
  <h2>Generate random sentences with less code repetition  <input class="checkbox hidden" type="checkbox"></h2>
  <p>When generating random sentences, we kept creating a random number (with
different bounds) and so on; now a single function does it generically:</p>
  <img alt="Generate random sentences with less code repetition" src="../img/stage-2-10-generate-sentences-with-functions.js.png">
  <p>The code is a bit longer than the original, but it is arguably more
readable and easier to write without making mistakes.</p>
